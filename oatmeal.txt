Prep Time: 2 minutes

Cook Time: 5 minutes

Yield: serves 1

What you'll need:

1 cup milk of choice, or water
1/2 cup rolled oats (I use Country Choice Organic)
1 small yellow peach (or half a large one), diced or cubed
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
1/4 tsp cinnamon
pinch of salt
1 tbsp almond butter
How to make it:

Bring milk (I use 1/2 c original almond milk and 1/2 c water) to a boil, add oats, and reduce heat to medium. (If you'd like to add flax or chia seeds, do so now. I used flax.)
Add diced peaches immediately.
Once more of the liquid has absorbed, add vanilla extract, cinnamon, and salt. Stir.
When you're pleased with the consistency of the oatmeal, transfer to a bowl. Either stir/swirl in the almond butter, or just put a dollop on top. (I did the latter for the pictures, but as soon as the camera was down, I stirred it in evenly, and it was heavenly.) Add another splash of your milk of choice and any other additional toppings (shredded coconut, nuts, etc.).
